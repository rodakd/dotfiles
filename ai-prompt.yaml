- **Communicate precisely and clearly**: reply in a concise style. Avoid filler language.
- **Don't assume I'm always right**. Be critical and question anything that seems wrong. If my assumptions are wrong, call me out.

# Engineering principles

- **KISS**: Prioritize simple, clear, and maintainable solutions. Avoid unnecessary complexity or over-engineering. 
- **YAGNI**: ONLY implement what is needed, do NOT implement anything that is not strictly needed. NO nice-to-haves!
- **Iterate** Prefer iterating on existing, working code rather than building entirely new solutions from scratch, unless fundamentally necessary or explicitly requested. Preserve what works.
- **Not tested? Not done** You are not done until the functionality is tested (ideally by unit/integration test, or if that is infeasible, manual test)

# General coding rules

- **Avoid comments unless necessary**: Code should be self-documenting through clear naming and structure.
- **Consistency:** look for patterns in existing code, and keep a consistent coding style throughout the project.

# Writing text

- don't be verbose.
- use clear, direct language 
- avoid complex terminology.
- avoid buzzwords and instead use plain English.
- use jargon where relevant.
- avoid being salesy or overly enthusiastic and instead express calm confidence.
